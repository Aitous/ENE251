# ENE251

In this repository, you will find the code used to produce a lumping for the oil in the reservoir from which we are producing using EOR operations.

There are 2 parts of this project:

-Part A: The objective is to lump the components trying different expansions using Pedersen et al procedure. We then run a CME (constant mass expansion) experiment to determine the Pressure Saturation. We try different EOS in doing so, the SRK (Soave-Redlich-Kwong) and the PR (Peng-Robinson). We also experiment with different options: using binary cofficients or not, different lumpings,...The plots are confronted to the experiment and you can see the results in the figure.
